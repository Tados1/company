This project is written predominantly using PHP, it also contains jQuery, JavaScript or HTML and CSS. It is connected to a SQL database. I made this project based on my current job, where I find it inefficient and a waste of time to wait at the beginning of working hours for a manager who comes to tell us who will be doing where and what work that day, instead I tried using this project to automate, besides there are several other functions in this project. There are 3 main roles: employee, manager and director. To log in, the user needs to enter a login name and password. If he enters correctly, a list of pages corresponding to his role will open. Employee can track what work he will do and can also send messages thanks to the form in the contact section. The Director can register new employees regardless of the role, and also edit or delete current employees. The manager has the most functions, he can assign work to employees, which will disappear from their page after 24 hours. He can add new employees who fall under him, but also edit or delete current employees. He can do the same with machines in the machines section.
For employee login, use login name emp01 to emp20, for manager from mng01 to mng03 and for director from dtc01 to dtc03, passwords are always the same as login names.
Furthermore, the site provides filtering and sorting functions, full responsiveness and also several visual effects.
