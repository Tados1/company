This project is primarily written in PHP, contains jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and connects to a SQL database. I suggested this project based on my experience in my current job, where I find it inefficient and time-wasting to wait at the beginning of working hours for a manager to tell us our tasks for the day (the exact work, machine). Instead, I tried using this project for automatization, and besides that, the project contains several other functions. 
There are three chief roles: employee, manager, and director. To log in, the user enters a login name and password. If the data are correct, a list of pages corresponding to his role will open. An employee can track their assigned work and can also send messages due to the form in the contact section. The director can register new employees regardless of the role and can also edit or delete the current employees. The manager has the highest number of functions. He can assign work to the employees which disappear from their page after 24 hours and add new employees who fall under him but also edit or delete the current employees. He can do the same with the machines in the machine section. 
To log in as an employee, use the login name emp01 to emp20, as a manager from mng01 to mng03, and as a director from dtc01 to dtc03. Passwords are always the same as login names. 
Furthermore, the site provides filtering and sorting of functions, full responsiveness, and also several visual effects.
